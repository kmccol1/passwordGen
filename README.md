# **passwordGen**

Securely generate strong passwords with ease using `passwordGen`, a Python-based GUI application. Whether you need a quick password for personal use or a robust one for secure environments, `passwordGen` simplifies the process while prioritizing usability and security.

---

## **Features**
- **User-friendly GUI** built with `Tkinter` for intuitive interaction.
- **Customizable password length** with support for lengths between 8 and 512 characters.
- **Password display** with a scrollable text box for readability.
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality for quick usage.
- **Save to file** feature to keep generated passwords secure.
- **Secure generation** using Python's `secrets` and `base64` libraries for cryptographically strong passwords.

---

## **How It Works**
1. Set the desired password length (default: 64 for strong security).
2. Click **Generate** to create a password.
3. Use the **Copy** button to send the password to your clipboard or **Save** to store it in a file.
4. The application ensures your password is securely generated and easily accessible.

## **Security**
`passwordGen` leverages:
- **Pythonâ€™s `secrets` library**, ensuring randomness suitable for security purposes.
- **Base64 encoding**, providing easily shareable yet complex password strings.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add more password customization options (e.g., include/exclude special characters).
- Enhance user interface design for modern aesthetics.
- Implement password strength indicators.
